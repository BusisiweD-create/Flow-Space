   - ✅ Signer name: Charlie Brown
   - ✅ Role: "Client Approval Signature"
   - ✅ Date signed
   - ✅ Green verification badge

4. ✅ Both signatures should be clearly visible and professional

**Expected Result:** ✅ Both signatures displayed with full details

---

### **TEST 5: Database Verification** 🗄️

**Goal:** Verify signatures are stored correctly in database

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Open PowerShell/Terminal

2. ✅ Run:
```bash
cd backend
node -e "const {Pool}=require('pg');const dbConfig=require('./database-config');const pool=new Pool(dbConfig);pool.query('SELECT signer_id, signer_role, signature_type, signed_at, is_valid FROM digital_signatures ORDER BY signed_at DESC LIMIT 5').then(r=>{console.table(r.rows);process.exit()});"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
┌─────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────┐
│ (index) │   signer_id     │   signer_role    │ signature_type  │  signed_at   │ is_valid │
├─────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────┤
│    0    │ [uuid]          │ 'clientReviewer' │    'manual'     │  [date]      │   true   │
│    1    │ [uuid]          │ 'deliveryLead'   │    'manual'     │  [date]      │   true   │
└─────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────┘
```

### **TEST 6: Try to Bypass Signature** 🚫

**Goal:** Ensure signatures can't be bypassed

**Test A: Skip delivery lead signature**
1. Create new report
2. Try to submit without signing
3. ✅ Should be blocked with error message

**Test B: Skip client signature**
1. Open submitted report
2. Try to approve without signing
3. ✅ Should be blocked with error message

**Test C: Backend validation**
- Backend should reject requests without signatures
- Returns 400 error: "Digital signature required"

**Expected Result:** ✅ All bypass attempts blocked

---

### **TEST 7: Signature Security** 🔒

**Goal:** Verify signature integrity

**Check in database:**
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres -d flow_space

-- Check signature hashes exist
SELECT 
  signer_role,
  LENGTH(signature_hash) as hash_length,
  ip_address,
  signed_at,
  is_valid
FROM digital_signatures
ORDER BY signed_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ signature_hash is 64 characters (SHA-256)
- ✅ ip_address is recorded
- ✅ signed_at timestamp present
- ✅ is_valid = true
